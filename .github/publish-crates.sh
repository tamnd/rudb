# Publishes the workspace to crates.io, and can be run a second time to finish what a first run
# started.
#
# `cargo publish --workspace` works out the dependency order itself and is what does the work
# here. The two things it does not do are why this script exists. crates.io rate limits updates to
# existing crates, so a workspace this size gets a 429 partway through often enough to plan for,
# and a second call after one of those stops at the first crate that is already up rather than
# carrying on past it. So this asks the index what is already there, excludes it, and waits when
# the registry tells it to wait.
#
# Run from the root of the workspace with CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN set. Running it when everything is
# already published is a no-op that exits zero, which is what makes re-running the release job the
# way to recover from a partial upload.
