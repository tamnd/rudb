//! What a table function call resolves to.
//!
//! A table function is a function written where a table goes, so `FROM range(10)` produces ten rows
//! of one column the same way `FROM t` produces whatever is in `t`. That makes it a different
//! resolution problem from [`crate::signature`]: the answer is not a return type, it is a list of
//! columns, because the caller can alias them and select from them and join against them.
//!
//! Two of them are here, `range` and `generate_series`, which between them account for two thousand
//! records in DuckDB's `sqllogictest` corpus. They exist because a test that needs a thousand rows
//! should not have to write a thousand rows, and the corpus uses them the way a person uses a for
//! loop. Everything else DuckDB has under this name reads a file or reads the catalog, and both of
//! those are their own piece of work rather than an entry in a table.
//!
//! The difference between the two is one row. `range` stops before the end and `generate_series`
//! stops on it, which is the difference between a half open interval and a closed one, and it is
//! the only difference. Nothing else about them differs, including the name of the column, which is
//! the function's own name in both cases.
