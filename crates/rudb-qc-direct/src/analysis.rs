//! The analysis pass of section 8.5 of `spec/compiler/08-backends.md`: loops, the block order,
//! liveness and the register hints, in one walk over the function and with no hash maps.
//!
//! The order is reverse postorder with the body of every loop kept together, which is what makes
//! a live range an interval. Every edge that is not a back edge goes forward, so a value is live
//! only between the block that defines it and the last block that uses it, except that a value
//! used inside a loop it is not defined in stays live to the end of that loop. That is Kohn's
//! liveness as TPDE does it, and it costs one pass over the uses instead of a dataflow fixpoint.
//! An interval is a block range and never smaller, which is conservative and is all the code
//! generator asks: whether a value is still wanted after the block it is in, and how many uses
//! it has left in the block where it dies.
//!
//! The hints are the values worth keeping in a callee saved register for their whole life, which
//! are the ones a loop reads. They are picked greedily by how deep in loops their uses are, and
//! two values share a register only when their intervals do not meet.
