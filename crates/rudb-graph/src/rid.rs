//! The row id, and the structure that turns one into a physical position.
//!
//! A rudb native table is stripes of sixty four parts of 1024 rows, appended in order, so a row
//! already has an ordinal: its position in append order over the whole table, zero based. That
//! ordinal is the row id, and [`Places`] is the prefix sum that resolves one.
//!
//! The three properties spec/graph/02-the-data-model.md section 2.1 requires of a `rid` are worth
//! restating here because two of them are properties of this module and one is not. Stability under
//! append is free from append order. Cheap resolution to a physical position is what [`Places`] is
//! for. Invalidation rather than corruption by a rewrite is not here at all: it is the generation
//! stamp on every section in the file, and it works because an ignored section changes no answer.
