//! The backward adjacency: for each parent row, the child rows that point at it.
//!
//! spec/graph/03-the-file-format.md section 3.5. The forward link answers which parent a child has,
//! and a reduction that starts from a set of parents and asks it has to ask every child. That is a
//! pass over the whole child table to find the few rows that point into the set, and on TPC-H q17
//! it is six million tests to find 6,088 lines of 204 parts. This answers the other way round: the
//! children of those 204 parts are read off directly, and the scan decodes those rows and no others.
//!
//! Compressed sparse row in the ordinary sense. The child rows are grouped by parent, ascending
//! within each parent, and bit-packed to the width the largest child row takes. Where each
//! parent's list starts is the same bit vector the monotone link uses: a run of ones per parent,
//! one per child, then a zero, so that the list of parent `p` is `[cum(p - 1), cum(p))` with
//! `cum(p) = select0(p) - p`. A parent with no children costs one bit.
//!
//! A relationship whose link is monotone needs none of this, because its children are already
//! grouped by parent in the table itself and the link answers both directions. So one is built only
//! for a link in the packed form, and a child with no parent is left out of every list.
//!
//! Section 3.5 also allows a delta form for lists whose average length is above about eight. That
//! is not here yet: the flat form is what the budget is measured against first, and the delta form
//! arrives when a measurement says the bytes matter more than the simplicity.
