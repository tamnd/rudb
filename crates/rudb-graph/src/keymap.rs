//! Turning a parent key value into a [`Rid`].
//!
//! A link is built from an equality between a child column and a parent column, and to build it the
//! parent column's values have to become row ids. That map is the key map. It has the three
//! physical forms of spec/graph/02-the-data-model.md section 2.2, chosen by measurement at build
//! time rather than by declaration, and the form that was chosen is recorded in the header so that
//! a reader does not have to guess.
//!
//! The three exist because they are three different answers to the same question and the cheapest
//! one is usually available:
//!
//! - [`Form::Identity`] when the keys are exactly `base .. base + n` in order. Nothing is stored
//!   but two numbers, and TPC-H hits this on six of its eight tables.
//! - [`Form::Dense`] when the keys are distinct integers packed densely enough into a range that a
//!   bitmap plus a rank index beats storing them.
//! - [`Form::Sorted`] for everything else, including every string key, which arrives here as
//!   dictionary codes rather than as text.
//!
//! What is deliberately absent is a hash. A minimal perfect hash is faster to probe than the sorted
//! form and much slower to build, and there is no measurement yet saying the probe is where the
//! time goes. spec/graph/11-open-questions.md keeps it open, and adding it later costs nothing
//! because the form is a tag in a header that a reader is already required to be able to not
//! recognize.
