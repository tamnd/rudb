//! The forward link: for each child row, the [`Rid`] of its parent.
//!
//! spec/graph/03-the-file-format.md section 3.4. One per relationship, in child `rid` order, with
//! [`NO_PARENT`] for a child whose key matched nothing. Two physical forms, chosen by measuring the
//! column rather than by declaring it, exactly as the key map's three are.
//!
//! [`Form::Packed`] is the general one: the parent `rid`s bit-packed to `ceil(log2(parent + 1))`
//! bits, with the maximum representable value meaning no parent. Random access is a shift and a
//! mask. It answers the child to parent direction and nothing else.
//!
//! [`Form::Monotone`] is the one that makes the budget in section 3.7 livable. When the child table
//! is physically clustered by the join key, which is how `dbgen` emits `lineitem` against `orders`
//! and `partsupp` against `part`, the parent `rid`s are non-decreasing and storing one integer per
//! child is a waste. The payload becomes a bit vector of `children + parents` bits: for each parent
//! in `rid` order, a run of one bits, one per child that points at it, then a zero. On TPC-H SF100
//! that is 93.8 MB against 2.10 GB for the packed form of the same relationship, and it answers
//! both directions, so the backward adjacency of section 3.5 does not have to exist for it.
//!
//! # The two formulas, and the convention that decides them
//!
//! Section 3.4 gives `forward(child) = rank0(select1(child))` and a backward formula beside it. The
//! two are only both true under one layout, and the one that makes the forward formula right is
//! ones first: parent zero's children, then a zero, then parent one's children, then a zero. Under
//! that layout a child's one bit has exactly as many zeros before it as its parent has `rid`, which
//! is the forward formula, and the backward formula is `[cum(parent - 1), cum(parent))` where
//! `cum(p) = select0(p) - p` is the number of children of every parent up to and including `p`.
//! The forward direction is the hot one, so it is the one the layout is chosen for.
//!
//! # What the monotone form refuses
//!
//! A child with no parent. Under the packed form that is a reserved value; under this one there is
//! nowhere to put it, because every bit is either a child of the parent whose run it is in or a
//! parent boundary. A relationship with an unmatched child is therefore packed even when its
//! matched children are in order, which is the honest answer and is what
//! [`Link::build`] does without being asked.
//!
//! # Where the part-skip statistic comes from
//!
//! Section 5.5 prunes a whole part during a semi-join reduction using the minimum and maximum
//! parent `rid` in that part. Section 3.4 expected that for free from the zone map of a stored
//! column. This link is a section payload rather than a stored column, for the reason section 3.8
//! sanctions: the parent's key map has to exist before the child's link can be built, so the link
//! is built in a second pass at checkpoint time, and a second pass can append a section to a
//! committed file but cannot go back and add a column to its stripes. So the statistic is stored
//! here instead, as a minimum and a maximum per [`PART_ROWS`] children, which is sixteen bytes per
//! thousand and change rows. The monotone form stores none, because a non-decreasing sequence's
//! minimum and maximum over a range are its two ends and two selects are cheaper than nine
//! megabytes.
