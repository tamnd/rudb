//! The bytes a key map takes in a section payload.
//!
//! spec/graph/03-the-file-format.md section 3.3 asks for a fixed header carrying what the build
//! observed, then the form's own payload. This module is that layout and nothing else: it does not
//! know what a section is, what an extent is or where in a file the bytes go, because
//! `rudb-native` is the crate that knows those and it is above this one.
//!
//! The header is forty bytes and not the twenty four section 3.3 quotes. Three reasons, and the
//! difference is worth naming rather than quietly absorbing. `base` has to be an `i128` because a
//! key can be a `HUGEINT` or a dictionary code and a key map that could not hold one would be a
//! key map with an exception in it. The null count has to be there because a null is not a key and
//! the row count alone does not say how many rows the column had. And section 3.3 also requires
//! the four observed facts in the header, which is where distinctness and sortedness live. Forty
//! bytes against twenty four, on the six TPC-H tables that take the identity form, is ninety six
//! bytes in total, so the fidelity that would be lost by padding it back down is worth more than
//! the bytes.
//!
//! What the header does not hold is the maximum key, because every form derives it: identity from
//! the count, dense from the range, sorted from its last stored key. A number stored twice is a
//! number that can disagree with itself.
