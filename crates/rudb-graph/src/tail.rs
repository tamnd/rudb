//! The back of a buffer a structure was read from, kept rather than copied.
//!
//! A forward link or an adjacency is read out of a section's payload, and most of the payload is
//! the packed rows at the end of it. Copying those rows into a buffer of their own wrote every one
//! of them to fresh memory a second time, and on TPC-H q21 loading the sections was about half the
//! page faults of a query whose system time was as large as its user time. Taking the payload
//! instead keeps the rows where the read put them, at the cost of the header in front of them.
