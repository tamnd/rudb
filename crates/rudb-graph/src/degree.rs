//! What a relationship knows about its own shape: the degree distribution, the certificates and
//! the gather locality.
//!
//! spec/stats/07-graph-statistics.md sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4. Five facts, all exact, all computed
//! from the same slice of parent `rid`s that [`crate::Link::build`] is already walking, so the
//! marginal cost of the lot is a histogram and three running sums.
//!
//! # Why these are not in the link's header
//!
//! Section 7.1's four numbers are: the child row count, the parent row count, the unmatched count
//! and the maximum degree. Three of those are in the forward link's header because the link cannot
//! be read without them. Nothing here is like that. A planner that has these plans better and a
//! planner that does not plans the way it planned before, which is the section 3.1 invariant and is
//! the definition of a statistic in this codebase.
//!
//! So this is its own section, and a build that runs out of budget before it gets here drops it and
//! keeps the link. The other way round would be a file whose statistics describe a relationship it
//! cannot resolve.
//!
//! # What a degree histogram can and cannot answer
//!
//! Thirty two log buckets, so a bucket is a doubling and the answer to *how many parents have about
//! this many children* is exact to within a factor of two. The mean is exact, because it is the
//! linked child count over the parent count and both are counted rather than bucketed. The maximum
//! is exact, because it is tracked on its own. A percentile is neither: [`Degrees::percentile`]
//! answers with a bucket's upper bound, which is the honest shape of the answer and is what the two
//! questions section 7.2 asks of it need.
//!
//! Those questions are worth restating, because they are why the buckets are here rather than only
//! the mean. A mean of four with a maximum of four is a uniform fan out that parallelises by parent.
//! A mean of four with a ninety ninth percentile of nine hundred is a workload where one worker gets
//! the whole tail and the scheduler should partition by edge. The mean alone does not tell those
//! apart and neither does the maximum alone, because one parent with a million children moves the
//! maximum and moves nothing else.
