//! What each codec cost the process and how often it was kept, for `rudb_codec_metrics()`.
//!
//! W1 asks the page builder for no codec that uses over 5% of encode time while being kept in
//! under 1% of offers. The number that started that rule, four codecs at 62.9% of encode time kept
//! 7 times in 1,195 offers, came from `cargo xtask encode`, which runs the exhaustive chooser over a
//! fixture. The writer does not run that chooser. It settles a shape on a sample and replays it, so
//! what the writer offers is much less than the fixture says, and the rule can only be checked by
//! counting in the writer.
//!
//! # What is counted
//!
//! The top level of every cascade and nothing under it. An offer is a candidate the chooser asked
//! for, kept is the one that came out smallest, and the time is the whole of that candidate's
//! encode with everything it cascaded into. So the times of one family add up to its encode time
//! and the share a codec has of it is the share of the writer's encode time its offers cost. A
//! dictionary's codes going through the integer cascade are inside the dictionary's time rather
//! than counted again as integers.
//!
//! # What it costs
//!
//! Two clock readings and three relaxed atomic adds per candidate per chunk, and a chunk is
//! thousands of values. The counters are process wide and never reset, so a reading is the
//! difference between two queries, or a fresh process with one load in it.
