//! Counting distinct values, and deciding whether two columns are related, without holding either
//! column in memory.
//!
//! Every decision in `spec/06-compression.md` section 6.4 and 6.5 starts with a question about a
//! column that is too big to answer exactly. Is this column worth a dictionary, which is a distinct
//! count. Do these two columns come from the same universe, which is an overlap between two value
//! sets. Is this column determined by that one, which is whether the pairs have as many distinct
//! values as the left side alone. Section 6.4 also says the pair space has to be pruned, because
//! 105 columns is 5,460 pairs and testing all of them exactly is not something a load can do.
//!
//! A bottom-k sketch answers all three from one pass per column and a fixed amount of memory.
//!
//! ## What it is
//!
//! Hash every value and keep the k smallest distinct hashes. That set is a uniform random sample of
//! the column's distinct values, chosen by a rule that does not depend on the order they arrived
//! in, so two sketches built on different machines from the same values are identical.
//!
//! The distinct count comes out of where the k smallest hashes end. If the hashes are uniform over
//! the 64 bit range, then after seeing `d` distinct values the kth smallest sits at about `k / d`
//! of the way through the range, so `d` is about `k` divided by that fraction. The standard
//! correction uses `k - 1` rather than `k`, which is what makes the estimate unbiased rather than
//! merely close. Relative error is about one over the square root of k, so the default k of 4096
//! is a bit under 2 percent, and a sketch that never filled up is not an estimate at all because
//! then it holds every distinct hash there was.
//!
//! The overlap between two columns comes from merging the two sketches and asking how many of the
//! k smallest hashes of the union are in both. That is the Jaccard similarity, and the reason it
//! works on sketches is that any hash small enough to be in the union's bottom k is small enough
//! that if it were in a column at all it would be in that column's own bottom k. So a lookup in the
//! sketch is a lookup in the column.
//!
//! ## Why not HyperLogLog
//!
//! Section 6.5 says HyperLogLog for the distinct count and that is the right structure if counting
//! is all you want, because it answers in a kilobyte where this wants tens. It cannot do the other
//! two questions. A HyperLogLog register holds a leading zero count and not a value, so two
//! HyperLogLogs can be merged into a count of the union but they cannot tell you which values the
//! union kept, and the intersection they give by inclusion and exclusion is the difference of three
//! noisy numbers, which for two columns that barely overlap is noise. The sketch here keeps actual
//! hashes, so an intersection is a set intersection and the error on it is the error on the sample
//! rather than the error on the difference. 128 KB per column at the default k, for 105 columns, is
//! 13 MB for a whole table, and the pair pruning it buys is worth more than the 13 MB.
//!
//! ## The hash
//!
//! Values are hashed with a multiply and fold over 8 byte words. It has to be uniform, because
//! every estimate here assumes it is, and the tests measure that rather than asserting it.
//!
//! It is now a persisted hash. A sketch is a section of a rudb file, so replacing the function
//! changes [`HASH_IDENTITY`], which every stored sketch carries and every reader checks, and the
//! sketches written by the old one are declined and rebuilt rather than merged into the new ones.
//! That is the ordinary stale-section path and it costs a rebuild. Merging across two hashes would
//! cost an answer, which is why the identity is in the bytes rather than in a comment.

///
/// # How it is held
///
/// The hashes live in an open addressed table rather than in a sorted run, because the add is on
/// the load path of every column of every table and a sorted run makes it cost a binary search a
/// row. Measured on server2 over fifty million values, against about 2 nanoseconds a value to hash
/// it in the first place:
///
/// | distinct values | sorted run | this table |
/// | --- | --- | --- |
/// | 10 | 9.0 ns | 6.7 ns |
/// | 1,000 | 22.7 ns | 6.8 ns |
/// | 100,000 | 5.6 ns | 6.1 ns |
/// | 50,000,000 | 2.6 ns | 3.7 ns |
///
/// The run was worst in the middle, where the search is long enough to matter and every branch in
/// it is a coin flip. At the two ends it was already cheap: a short run fits in a cache line, and a
/// column with far more distinct values than k turns nearly every row away on the threshold before
/// the search happens. The table trades a little of those two ends for the middle, which is where
/// most columns of most tables are.
///
/// The table holds more than k. Keeping exactly the k smallest at every moment would mean finding
/// and dropping the largest every time a smaller one arrives, and that is a pass over the table for
/// each of them. So it fills to half its slots, then keeps the k smallest of those in one pass and
/// sets the threshold to the largest it kept. Between two of those passes it holds a superset of
/// the bottom k and turns away anything at or above the threshold, which is all but a vanishing
/// fraction of a large column. The pass happens about `ln(d / k)` times for a column of `d`
/// distinct values, which for a hundred million is around ten.
///
/// That costs memory: 16,384 slots of 8 bytes is 128 KB a column at the default k, and a hundred
/// and five of them is 13 MB. A sorted run of k would have been 32 KB, and the four times is bought
/// with the load time, which is the scarcer of the two here.
