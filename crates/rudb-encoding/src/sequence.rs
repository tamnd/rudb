//! Whether a string holds some pieces in order, answered on its FSST codes without decompressing it.
//!
//! `LIKE '%special%requests%'` asks whether `special` is somewhere in a string and `requests` is
//! somewhere after it. Finding each piece as soon as it can be found is never worse than finding it
//! later, so the question is a walk over the bytes with one automaton per piece, each one handing
//! over to the next when its piece is complete. Laid end to end that is one automaton with a state
//! for every byte of every piece and one more for having found them all, and a string holds the
//! pieces when its walk ends in that last state.
//!
//! A compressed string is codes, and each code stands for up to eight bytes. Walking a code is
//! walking its bytes, and since the bytes a code stands for do not change within a chunk, where a
//! code takes each state can be worked out once per chunk and then looked up. A string is then one
//! lookup per code rather than a decompression, a copy and a search over the bytes, and the lookups
//! are filled in only for the states a string actually reached. See `spec/perf/44-like-on-codes.md`.
//!
//! Walking is still a step per code for every string, and a filter that keeps nearly every row
//! walks nearly every string to the end. [`grams`] is the sketch that saves the walk: a bit for
//! each run of three bytes a string holds, hashed into sixty four. A string that holds a piece
//! holds every run of three in it, so a string whose sketch lacks one of the piece's bits cannot
//! hold the piece, and only the strings whose sketch has all of them are walked. The writer keeps
//! one sketch per row of a long text column, see `spec/graph/12-the-order-the-suite-asks-for.md`.
