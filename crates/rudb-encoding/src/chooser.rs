//! How the encoder decides which candidate to keep.
//!
//! The encoders in [`crate::string`] and [`crate::integer`] are the work. This is the search. They
//! are separate things and until now they were the same thing, because `encode` both offered every
//! candidate and encoded every candidate it offered, and there was no way to have one without the
//! other.
//!
//! # Why it is worth separating
//!
//! `cargo xtask encode` over a million rows of ClickBench `hits` says where the encoder's seconds
//! go. String `FRONT` is 32.2 percent of them and is kept once in 142 chunks. String `FSST` is 11.2
//! percent and is kept twice in 223. Integer `DELTA` is 10.8 percent and is kept never in 607.
//! String `PLAIN` is 8.7 percent and is kept four times in 223. Those four are 62.9 percent of the
//! encoder's time and they were kept seven times out of 1,195 offers.
//!
//! That is not a bug in any encoder. It is what an exhaustive search costs, and the search is worth
//! something: the shapes it arrives at are five to one on `hits` and nobody wrote them down in
//! advance. The question is how much of the search is needed, which is a question about the data
//! and therefore a question to measure rather than argue about. F2 asks for exactly this, as "the
//! encoder chooser as a seam, with exhaustive and sampled implementations", with the ablation being
//! how much size the sampled one gives up.
//!
//! # What a chooser sees and what it does not
//!
//! A chooser is asked once per chunk per level of the cascade, never once per value. It is handed
//! the values and the candidates that apply and it returns the ones worth encoding in full. It
//! cannot invent a candidate that does not apply, so nothing it does can produce a chunk that will
//! not decode, and the worst a bad chooser can do is pick a bigger encoding than another one would
//! have. That is the property that makes this safe to swap.
//!
//! # Not a `rudb-seam` seam yet, and why
//!
//! `SeamId::StorageEncoder` exists and says "how a block of values is encoded on the way to disk",
//! and this is what belongs behind it. It cannot be registered here: `rudb-seam` is rank 2 and so is
//! this crate, so the `Strategy` supertrait every seam trait needs is not visible from here. The
//! registry goes in `rudb-storage` at rank 5, next to the write path, and there is no write path
//! yet. Until there is, this is a plain trait with two implementations and an ablation, which is
//! the part that can be measured today.
