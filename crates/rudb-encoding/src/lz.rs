//! A match finder, which is the one thing this crate did not have.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Every other encoding here is a local transform. Front coding looks at exactly one value back.
//! FSST builds 255 symbols of at most eight bytes. Run length encoding looks at the previous value.
//! None of them can say "this forty character path segment appeared six hundred values ago", and on
//! the data this engine is measured against that is where most of the redundancy is.
//!
//! Measured on one chunk of 122,880 sorted URLs out of ClickBench `hits`, in tiles of about 190 KB
//! so a lookup decompresses a tile rather than a chunk. The cascade without this got 3.16 times.
//! Front coding followed by this, with the three streams below handed to the encoders that already
//! existed, got 5.15 times. deflate at the same tile size got 5.00 and zstd at level three got
//! 5.63. Issue #575 has the full table.
//!
//! # Why there is no entropy coder
//!
//! Because it is not where the win is, which was worth measuring rather than assuming. The same
//! matcher with byte aligned tokens gets 3.57 times, barely above the 3.16 the cascade already
//! managed. Sending the same tokens through [`crate::integer`] instead gets 4.40. So what makes
//! matching pay here is the bitpacking and frame of reference this crate already has, applied to
//! the length and offset streams, and not a Huffman coder anybody has to write.
//!
//! # The three streams
//!
//! A token is a run of literal bytes followed by a copy from earlier in the output. The literal runs
//! go back through the string cascade, so FSST still gets a go at the bytes no match covered, and
//! the lengths and offsets go through the integer cascade. Splitting them matters: interleaved
//! tokens are three distributions in one stream and none of the integer encodings can see any of
//! them.
//!
//! # The segment
//!
//! Matching restarts every [`SEGMENT`] bytes. That bounds the hash chain's memory, which would
//! otherwise be one entry per byte of a 23 MB chunk, and it bounds the worst case search. Offsets
//! are still written relative to the whole output, so a decoder copies from `out.len() - offset`
//! and never has to know where a segment began.
