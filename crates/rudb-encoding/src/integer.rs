//! The single column integer encodings and the cascade over them.
//!
//! `spec/06-compression.md` section 6.2 lists the encoding set and section 6.3 says the ratios are
//! in the cascade rather than in any one encoding. This module is both: the seven candidate shapes
//! for an integer column, each of which encodes its own output by calling back into the chooser, so
//! that RLE over a dictionary over a bit packed code array is a thing that happens by construction
//! rather than a case somebody wrote out.
//!
//! Everything here works on `i64`. A narrower column is widened on the way in and nothing is lost
//! by it, because every encoding's size comes from the range of the values rather than from the
//! declared width of the type: a `SMALLINT` column of values 100 to 130 packs to 5 bits whether it
//! arrived as `i16` or as `i64`. The one place the widening would cost something is a raw copy, and
//! there is no raw copy, because a bit packed unit at width 64 is exactly that and the chooser
//! reaches it on its own when nothing else fits.
//!
//! ## The unit
//!
//! Bit packing is per 1024 values, per [`crate::bitpack`]. Everything else is per chunk, where a
//! chunk is however many values the caller passes in and is meant to be a row group. The two
//! granularities are the point rather than an accident. A frame of reference base that is chosen
//! per 1024 values tracks a column that drifts, which is what a timestamp column and an
//! autoincrementing key both do, and one base per row group would pay the whole range of the row
//! group on every value. A dictionary, on the other hand, is worth more the larger the unit it
//! covers, which is the argument section 6.5 takes all the way to a dictionary per table.
//!
//! ## The serialized form
//!
//! A chunk is a tag byte, a value count, and a body whose shape depends on the tag. Bodies that
//! contain another array of integers contain a whole chunk, tag and all, which is what makes the
//! decoder a fold and what makes the cascade free: nothing in `Rle` knows what its run lengths are
//! encoded as. The header is fixed width little endian rather than a varint, because 5 bytes per
//! chunk against a chunk that holds a row group is not worth the branch on the decode path.
//!
//! ## What the chooser does, and what it will have to do instead
//!
//! It encodes every candidate and keeps the smallest. That is the honest baseline for M1, which is
//! a measurement of what the format can do rather than of how fast a writer can decide, and it is
//! not what a write path can afford. Section 6.3 describes the real thing: evaluate the candidates
//! on a systematic sample, not the first N rows, because column data is frequently clustered and
//! the first 1024 rows of a sorted column look constant. Building that first would mean the numbers
//! this milestone produces are the sampler's numbers rather than the format's, and there would be
//! no way to tell how much the sampler is leaving behind.
