//! Bit packing in the FastLanes unified transposed layout.
//!
//! Packing N values of a fixed bit width into a dense buffer is the bottom of every integer
//! encoding in `spec/06-compression.md` section 6.2. FOR subtracts a base and packs. DELTA
//! differences and packs. DICT produces codes and packs them. So this is the one kernel that runs
//! over more bytes than anything else in the system, and the layout it uses decides whether the
//! decoder can be data parallel or has to walk a dependency chain.
//!
//! The obvious layout writes value 0 in the low bits of the first word, value 1 above it, and so
//! on. Unpacking that requires knowing where the previous value ended, which is a sequential
//! dependency, and a SIMD implementation has to fight it with shuffles that differ per width and
//! per instruction set. FastLanes takes the other road. The 1024 values of a vector are seen as a
//! matrix of `T` rows by `1024 / T` lanes, where `T` is the bit width of the type, and the packing
//! runs down the rows of every lane at once. Every lane has the same bit schedule, so unpacking
//! lane 0 and lane 31 is the same instruction sequence with no cross lane data movement at all.
//! That is what makes one scalar reference implementation and one AVX-512 implementation and one
//! NEON implementation agree bit for bit, and it is why the vector size is 1024 rather than a
//! rounder number.
//!
//! The price is that the values come out permuted within the vector. Row `r` lane `l` is not the
//! `r * lanes + l`th value of the input. Section 6.2 says why that is acceptable: an operator
//! working inside one vector does not care what order the rows are in, so the permutation only
//! has to be undone when a vector is materialized in row order. [`transpose`] and [`untranspose`]
//! are that step, and they are deliberately separate from [`pack_transposed`] and
//! [`unpack_transposed`] so that the engine can keep data permuted through a whole pipeline and
//! pay for the reordering once at the end rather than twice per operator.
//!
//! There is a second layout in here, in [`pack_tail`], and it is the sequential one this module
//! opens by arguing against. The transposed layout is all or nothing: a value lives at a row and a
//! lane, the lanes are interleaved through the whole buffer, and no prefix of a packed unit holds a
//! prefix of the values. So a unit holding 3 values costs exactly what a unit holding 1024 costs,
//! and a cascade is full of short arrays. A five entry dictionary, a run length array, an exception
//! list. Storing three numbers in 5 KB is not a compressed format. The tail packer handles anything
//! shorter than a unit, it has the dependency chain the transposed layout exists to avoid, and that
//! is affordable there and nowhere else, because a tail is at most 1023 values and is decoded once
//! while a full unit is on the hot path of every scan in the system.
//!
//! The permutation itself is a fixed shuffle of the eight bit groups of a row index, in the order
//! 0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7. That order is not arbitrary. It is the one that makes an eight way
//! interleave of the rows land back in sequence under the pairwise unpacking pattern the paper
//! uses, and the important property for us is only that it is a bijection that both directions
//! agree on.
