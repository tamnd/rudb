//! The string column, which is offsets, bytes, and the choice between compressing the bytes and
//! not storing most of them at all.
//!
//! ClickBench `hits` is a string dataset before it is anything else. `URL`, `Referer`, `Title` and
//! the referer derived columns are most of the 20.46 GB DuckDB writes for it, so most of what
//! `spec/02-the-goal.md` promises on the resource axis has to come out of this file.
//!
//! ## The five shapes
//!
//! `CONSTANT` when every value is the same. `PLAIN`, which is lengths and raw bytes and is the
//! baseline the others have to beat. `FSST`, which is a symbol table and the same lengths over
//! compressed bytes. `DICT`, which is the distinct values and an array of codes. `FRONT`, which is
//! the length of the prefix each value shares with the one before it and the rest of the value.
//!
//! `DICT_FSST` from the section 6.2 table is not a sixth shape. A dictionary's entries are a string
//! column, and encoding them goes back through the same chooser, so a dictionary whose entries are
//! FSST compressed is what the chooser produces on its own whenever that is smaller. The same
//! recursion gives run length encoding of strings for free, because the codes are an integer chunk
//! and `crate::integer` already knows what to do with a column of long runs.
//!
//! ## Why front coding is here
//!
//! The whole file measurement in M1 says the chooser produces 11.65 GB for `hits` against Parquet's
//! 13.76 GB, and that `URL`, `Referer` and `OriginalURL` are 6.11 GB of it, and that on those three
//! the chooser loses to Parquet's Snappy. The shape it picked on all three was `DICT(FSST[255])`,
//! so the cascade was working and FSST was still losing.
//!
//! The reason is structural. FSST compresses each value on its own against a 255 symbol table, and
//! a block compressor has the previous few kilobytes of the page to point back into. Two URLs that
//! share a host and half a path are most of a back reference to each other and are nothing at all
//! to a symbol table, which can only spend eight bytes of a symbol on the part they share and has
//! to spend it again on every value. On a sorted dictionary of URLs the value before is the closest
//! thing in the column to the value in hand, and the bytes they share are the redundancy Snappy was
//! finding. Front coding is what reaches those bytes, and it composes with everything else here:
//! the suffixes it leaves behind are a string column and go back through the chooser, so
//! `DICT(FRONT(FSST))` is a shape the chooser can arrive at without anyone naming it.
//!
//! The chain has no restarts, so reading entry `n` means walking from entry zero. That is the right
//! trade while a dictionary is decoded whole, which is what `decode` does. When something wants one
//! entry out of a dictionary without materialising the rest, the answer is a restart every so many
//! entries, and it costs one full value per block.
//!
//! ## Lengths, not offsets
//!
//! The usual layout is `n + 1` offsets and Arrow does it that way because a slice of an array has
//! to be free. On disk the offsets are a monotonically increasing sequence whose differences are
//! the lengths, and the differences are what compress: URL lengths in a real column are a few dozen
//! distinct values in a narrow band, which the integer cascade turns into a handful of bits each,
//! while the offsets themselves need enough bits to address the whole chunk. The integer cascade
//! would find that by choosing DELTA, and storing lengths directly gets to the same place without
//! spending a level of the cascade on it. Offsets are a prefix sum away and that is a decode time
//! cost of one add per value.
//!
//! ## What is not here
//!
//! Nulls. A chunk here is N byte strings and an empty string is a value like any other. Validity is
//! a bitmap that belongs to the column rather than to the encoding, per `spec/05-storage.md`, and
//! `ROARING` in the section 6.2 table is what encodes it.
//!
//! Shared symbol tables and shared dictionaries across columns, which are section 6.4 and are the
//! measurement this milestone exists for. Everything here is one column on its own, which is the
//! baseline they get compared against.
