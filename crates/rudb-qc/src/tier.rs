//! The tiers a pipeline function runs on, per section 8.1 of `spec/compiler/08-backends.md`:
//! `interp`, which always exists, `direct`, the single pass x86-64 backend, on x86-64, and
//! `clif`, the Cranelift backend, when the build has the `qc-clif` feature. Both backends need a
//! platform with a code arena.
//!
//! Every function is lowered for the interpreter, whatever the tier. That is the fallback for a
//! function a backend does not lower, and it is what lets a query move between the tiers at
//! a morsel boundary: the two agree on the state and the morsel to the byte, so either one can
//! pick up where the other stopped.
//!
//! [`Switch`] moves a query between the tiers at morsel boundaries, which is the tier differential
//! of section 15 of the spec: the same query with and without the moves has to give the same bits.
//!
//! A function a backend refuses, or panics on, runs on `interp` and the refusal is kept in the
//! [`Report`]. A query never fails because a backend could not compile it.
//!
//! Nothing is compiled when the query is. Each pipeline's function is compiled when the pipeline
//! starts, which is rule I3 of section 9.3 of `spec/compiler/09-tiering-and-caching.md`, and a
//! pipeline that never starts costs nothing. Under `auto` a pipeline whose input is known to be at
//! most one morsel from what storage or the stage before it says runs on `interp` without being
//! compiled, which is rule I1, and every other one is compiled on `direct`, which is rule I2.
//!
//! A pipeline `auto` compiled on `direct` may then move up to `clif` while it runs, when the rows
//! it has left make the compile pay for itself, which the [`up`] module decides.
