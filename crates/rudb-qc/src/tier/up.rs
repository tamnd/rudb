//! Tier-up, per sections 9.4 and 9.5 of `spec/compiler/09-tiering-and-caching.md`.
//!
//! A pipeline that `auto` compiled on `direct` counts the rows it has done and the time its
//! workers spent on them. At a morsel boundary, at most once per [`Calibration::period`], the
//! worker that just finished a morsel weighs staying on `direct` against compiling on `clif`, with
//! Kohn's extrapolation over the rows the pipeline has left, which are known exactly because the
//! size of every input is. When `clif` wins by at least its own compile time, the function is
//! compiled on a thread of its own while the workers go on, and each worker picks the new code up
//! at its next morsel. A pipeline tiers up at most once, and a compile that fails leaves it where
//! it is.
