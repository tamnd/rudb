//! Executable memory, per section 8.8 of `spec/compiler/08-backends.md`: the one [`CodeArena`]
//! every native backend's code is loaded into, the loader that resolves a backend's relocations,
//! and the epochs that decide when an extent nobody can be running is given back.
//!
//! A backend never maps memory. It hands over bytes and relocations, and [`CodeArena::load`] finds
//! an extent, copies the bytes through a writable view, patches the relocations there, makes the
//! instruction cache agree with what was written and returns a [`Code`] whose address is in an
//! executable view. The code is patched before anybody can call it and never after, which is the
//! spec's rule that there is no in-place patching of published code.
//!
//! How the two views are made depends on the platform, and it is the only part that does:
//!
//! - Linux maps one `memfd` twice, once readable and writable and once readable and executable.
//!   No page is ever writable and executable at the same address and nothing needs a syscall per
//!   load, which is why it is the default. On AArch64 the data cache is cleaned and the
//!   instruction cache invalidated over what was written, and a caller issues an `isb` before it
//!   jumps (see [`Code::call`]).
//! - Linux in strict mode maps one private view and flips each extent with `mprotect`, writable
//!   while it is loaded and executable after. That costs a syscall and a TLB shootdown per extent,
//!   and it is for deployments that forbid a writable alias of executable memory.
//! - macOS maps with `MAP_JIT` and, on arm64, switches the calling thread between writing and
//!   executing with `pthread_jit_write_protect_np`, then calls `sys_icache_invalidate`.
//!
//! Any other platform has no arena, [`CodeArena::new`] says so, and `interp` is the only tier.
//!
//! # Extents and chunks
//!
//! Memory is mapped a chunk of 1 MB at a time and handed out in extents whose size is a power of
//! two number of pages, by bumping a pointer through the newest chunk. A freed extent goes on the
//! free list of its size class and the next load of that class takes it. A chunk whose last extent
//! was freed is unmapped, unless it is the one being bumped through. Code bigger than a chunk gets a
//! chunk of its own, sized to it, which goes back to the system when the code does.
//!
//! # Epochs
//!
//! Dropping a [`Code`] does not free its extent. It retires it in the current epoch and moves the
//! epoch on. A worker holds a [`Worker`] while it runs compiled code and calls [`Worker::boundary`]
//! at every morsel boundary, which is one store of the epoch it saw. An extent retired in epoch `e`
//! is freed once every worker has announced `e + 1` or later, that is once every worker has been
//! between two morsels since the code was dropped. In safe Rust a thread running a [`Code`] holds a
//! reference to it and the drop cannot happen first, so the epochs are for what the ownership rules
//! cannot see: an entry point copied into a code cache or a state block and called through a raw
//! pointer, which is what document 09 publishes.
//!
//! Only 64 bit Linux and macOS are supported, the two the release matrix builds for, and the
//! system calls are declared here rather than taken from a `libc` crate because there are seven of
//! them.
