//! QIR, the query compiler's intermediate representation, as `spec/compiler/06-qir.md`
//! describes it.
//!
//! A module is a set of pipeline functions and the tables they refer to. A function is a list of
//! blocks, and a block is a flat arena of 32-bit words: a header, a result, operands. Values are
//! dense numbers with their types in a side column, constants live in a pool, and SSA uses block
//! parameters. The builder folds constants and shares pure instructions as it appends, which is
//! the only optimization QIR does before a backend sees it, apart from the linear passes of
//! section 6.11.
//!
//! The crate depends on nothing, so that every backend, the interpreter included, can use it
//! without pulling in the rest of the engine.
