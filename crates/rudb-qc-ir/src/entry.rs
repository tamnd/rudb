//! The runtime entry points native code calls, named here so that a backend and the runtime
//! agree on them without depending on each other.
//!
//! A native backend knows what it calls only by these names. Its relocations name an [`Entry`],
//! and `rudb-qc-rt` owns the one table that turns an entry into an address, at load time. That
//! keeps a backend at the rank of this crate, below the runtime, and it keeps compiled code free
//! of addresses, so that compiling stays a pure function of the QIR (section 8.3 of
//! `spec/compiler/08-backends.md`).
//!
//! Every entry takes and returns plain integers and pointers in the C calling convention. The
//! first four reach the query's runtime through the context pointer the driver stores in the
//! state header's `rt` field before a call. The three `eval` entries are the fallback for an
//! operation a backend does not lower inline: they run the same [`crate::eval`] code the
//! interpreter runs, on operands the caller has spilled to a buffer, so the answer cannot differ.
