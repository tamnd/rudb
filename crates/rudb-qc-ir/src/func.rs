//! Functions, blocks, values and the module tables, per `spec/compiler/06-qir.md` sections 6.2 and
//! 6.9.
//!
//! A block's instructions are one `Vec<u32>`. An instruction is a header word, then its result
//! value if it has one, then its operand words as its [`Form`] lays them out. The header is the
//! opcode in 8 bits, the header type in 5, flags in 5 and the number of words that follow in 14.
//! Section 6.2 gives the count 6 bits and keeps 8 reserved, and that turned out to be too few for
//! a `switch` or a `brif` carrying a loop's state, so the reserved bits went to the count.
