//! FSST, the string encoding.
//!
//! Fast Static Symbol Table, from the 2020 paper by Boncz, Neumann and Leis. A table of at most 255
//! symbols of one to eight bytes each, and compression is replacing the longest matching symbol at
//! each position with its one byte code. A byte that no symbol covers is escaped, which costs two
//! bytes, so the table has to be good or the output is larger than the input.
//!
//! ## Why this and not a general compressor
//!
//! `spec/06-compression.md` section 6.2 is blunt about it. FSST compresses text about 2x, which is
//! worse than what zstd does to the same bytes, and the ratio is not why it is here. Two other
//! properties are.
//!
//! The first is random access. Every string in a column is compressed independently against a
//! shared table, so reading row 4,000,000 does not mean decompressing the four million before it. A
//! block compressor gives up that property and gets it back by cutting the data into blocks, which
//! means reading one string decompresses a block.
//!
//! The second is that a substring search can run against the compressed bytes. Compress the needle
//! with the same symbol table and look for the compressed needle in the compressed haystack. That is
//! what turns `URL LIKE '%google%'` from a decompress and scan into a scan, and section 6.7 says it
//! is worth more on the ClickBench workload than any ratio improvement. It needs care, because the
//! greedy match that compresses a needle standing alone can segment it differently from the way the
//! same bytes were segmented inside a longer string, so a hit is a candidate and a miss is not a
//! proof. The scan that uses it is M3 work and lives with the rest of encoded execution.
//!
//! ## Training
//!
//! The table is built from a sample rather than from the whole column, and the algorithm is the
//! paper's: start with nothing, so every byte escapes, then repeat five times. Compress the sample
//! with the table you have, count how often each symbol is used and how often each pair of adjacent
//! symbols occurs, and build the next table from the best 255 of the symbols and the concatenations
//! by gain, where gain is how many bytes of input the symbol accounts for. Five generations is what
//! the paper found, and the shape of the thing is that the first generation learns single bytes, the
//! second learns pairs, and the fifth is finding eight byte symbols like `https://`.
//!
//! ## Matching
//!
//! Three lookups in a fixed order, longest first. A hash table on the first three bytes for symbols
//! of three bytes and up, a flat table indexed by the first two bytes, and a flat table indexed by
//! the first one. The hash table probes eight slots and keeps the longest symbol that matches rather
//! than the first, because several symbols share a three byte prefix and taking the first would make
//! the ratio depend on insertion order.
